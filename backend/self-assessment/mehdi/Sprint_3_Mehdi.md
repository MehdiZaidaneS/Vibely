# 🧩 Self-Assessment Report

## 📘 Project Overview
This codebase implementss a **user management and social interaction system** using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Mongoose**. It supports:
- User authentication (JWT)
- User creation and login
- Friend requests and acceptance
- Event participation
- Notifications and activities tracking

---

## 🧠 Architecture & Design

### ✅ Strengths
- **Modular structure:** Controllers and middleware are logically separated (`requireAuth`, user controller).
- **Use of Mongoose population:** Enables relational-like behavior for fetching connected models (friends, requests, events).
- **Token-based authentication:** JWT is used securely to manage user sessions.
- **Activity and notification models:** Promotes user engagement tracking.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
| Area | Issue | Suggested Improvement |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| **Controller size** | The main user controller file is large and handles many responsibilities. | Split into smaller controllers (e.g., `friendController.js`, `eventController.js`, `authController.js`). |
| **Hard-coded logic** | Some features (like `expiresIn: "3d"`) are hardcoded. | Move such configurations to `.env` or a centralized config module. |
| **Error handling** | Repeated `try-catch` patterns clutter code. | Implement a centralized error handler middleware. |
| **Logging** | Excessive `console.log()` in production routes. | Replace with structured logging using libraries like `winston` or `pino`. |

---

## 🔒 Security Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- JWT tokens are verified against `process.env.SECRET`.
- Passwords are securely hashed with `bcrypt`.
- Input validation uses the `validator` library.

### ⚠️ Vulnerabilities / Risks
| Risk | Description | Recommended Action |
|------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Token leakage** | `console.log()` prints JWTs and sensitive info. | Remove debug logs from production. |
| **No rate limiting** | APIs can be spammed (e.g., friend requests). | Implement rate limiting (e.g., with `express-rate-limit`). |
| **Lack of sanitization** | Direct use of user inputs (e.g., `query` in search). | Add input sanitization to prevent regex DoS or injection. |
| **Error message exposure** | Full error details are returned to clients. | Send generic error messages to users and log specifics server-side. |

---

## 🧩 Code Quality

### ✅ Positives
- Consistent use of async/await.
- Proper validation for ObjectIDs using `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid`.
- Static methods for signup and login encapsulate user logic.

### ⚠️ Issues
| Category | Issue | Example | Fix |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----|
| **Duplication** | `checkUserName` exported twice. | `module.exports = { checkUserName, ... }` | Remove duplicate export. |
| **Readability** | Long functions like `getAllUsers` mix logic and formatting. | Break into helper functions (`formatUserList()`, `getMutualFriends()`). |
| **Error consistency** | Mixed error keys (`message`, `error`). | Standardize responses: `{ success, message, data }`. |
| **Data validation** | No schema validation on update requests. | Use libraries like `Joi` or `Yup`. |

---

## ⚙️ Database Layer (Mongoose)

### ✅ Good Practices
- Schema design supports relationships (friends, friend_requests).
- Proper use of `populate()` for nested data.
- Password hashing implemented with salt.

### ⚠️ Possible Issues
| Problem | Explanation | Suggested Fix |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Friend requests duplication risk** | Race conditions could lead to duplicate requests. | Use `$addToSet` or unique compound indexing. |
| **Performance scaling** | Deep population chains may slow down queries. | Implement lean queries or pagination for larger datasets. |
| **Indexing** | No visible indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `email`, `username`). | Add MongoDB indexes to improve search speed. |

---

## 🔄 Functionality Coverage

| Feature | Implemented | Tested | Comment |
|----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| User signup/login | ✅ | ⚠️ | Unit tests needed for validation & error handling. |
| Friend request/acceptance | ✅ | ⚠️ | Logic works but lacks concurrency safety. |
| Event join/leave | ✅ | ⚠️ | Handles both user and event update correctly. |
| Search users | ✅ | ⚠️ | Should sanitize query inputs. |
| Notifications & activities | ✅ | ⚠️ | No read/unread tracking or cleanup mechanism. |

---

## 🧪 Testing & Maintainability

### ✅ Positives
- Separation of logic facilitates testing.
- Predictable function names and parameters.

### ⚠️ To Improve
| Category | Issue | Suggested Solution |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| **Automated testing** | No Jest or Mocha tests provided. | Add unit tests for auth, user creation, and friend operations. |
| **Error case coverage** | Limited negative case handling. | Write tests for invalid/missing fields and bad tokens. |
| **Mocking external models** | Models imported directly into controllers. | Use dependency injection or mocking frameworks. |

---

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

| Concern | Current Handling | Recommendation |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Database queries | Multiple nested populations. | Use aggregation pipelines or caching (Redis). |
| Friend operations | Linear scans over arrays. | Refactor to set-based operations or indexed queries. |
| Notifications | Stored per user, no pagination. | Implement pagination and limit old records. |

---

## 🧰 Summary Recommendations

1. **Refactor controllers into smaller units** for clarity and testability.  
2. **Implement a unified error handler** (middleware-based).  
3. **Add unit and integration tests** with Jest/Mocha.  
4. **Enhance input sanitization** for all user-facing routes.  
5. **Introduce rate limiting and request validation**.  
6. **Remove debug logs** and replace with structured production logging.  
7. **Add pagination and indexes** for friend lists, events, and searches.

## 🧾 Overall Assessment

| Category | Rating (1–5) | Comments |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Code Readability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Clear and logically structured. |
| Security | ⭐⭐⭐ | Needs sanitization and rate limiting. |
| Maintainability | ⭐⭐⭐ | Too many responsibilities in one file. |
| Scalability | ⭐⭐⭐ | Will slow down with large datasets. |
| Testing Readiness | ⭐⭐ | Missing test framework integration. |

**Final Verdict:**  
> The codebase demonstrates a solid foundation for a social network backend with secure authentication and friend interactions. However, it requires modular refactoring, stricter validation, and comprehensive testing to be production-ready at scale.
