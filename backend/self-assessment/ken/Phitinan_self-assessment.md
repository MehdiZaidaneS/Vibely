### In general

- Good Points:
Clean REST structure (POST for create, GET for fetching, PATCH for join/leave).

Consistent route naming

- Improvements needed:

no authentication middleware

### Event components

- Improvements needed:

no data validation in request bodies (title, type, date etc.). Use something like Joi or express-validator.

Joining/leaving events updates both event.participant and user.joinedEvents separately â€” risk of inconsistency if one fails. Consider wrapping in a transaction with session (MongoDB).

no checking if the event is full before allowing join.

### AI recommendation

- Improvements needed:

depending on Gemini to always return perfect JSON is risky. Youâ€™re handling json fenced code, but if Gemini returns plain {}, your regex might miss edge cases.
â†’ Suggestion: Use a JSON parser with fallback (strip markdown, try parse multiple times).

Fetching all events every time could be expensive. Instead, filter in Mongo first using preferences (e.g., Event.find({ date: { $gte: preferredDate } })).


### LLM scoring

âœ… If I had to score this project so far (out of 20):

Functionality: 15/20 (it works, but join/leave not secure yet).

Code quality: 14/20 (clear structure, but needs validation & transactions).

Scalability: 12/20 (LLM parsing + fetching all events may not scale).

ðŸ‘‰ Overall: ~13.5/20 â€” solid foundation, but needs tightening around auth, validation, and robustness.
