## âœ… What's Working Well (Strengths)

* **Flawless Auto-Dismiss Logic:** The `useEffect` hook to handle the timer is implemented perfectly. It correctly sets a `setTimeout` when the toast becomes visible and includes a cleanup function (`clearTimeout`) to prevent memory leaks if the component unmounts or the `visible` prop changes.
* **Flexible and Reusable:** Providing props like `type` and `duration` with sensible default values makes this component incredibly versatile and easy to use across your entire application.
* **Strong Accessibility:** Using `role="status"` is the correct way to ensure that the message is announced by screen readers without being disruptive. The close button is a proper `<button>` with a descriptive `aria-label`, which is also excellent.
* **Clean and Efficient:** The component is lightweight, and the early `return null` makes it very performant.

## ðŸ’¡ Areas for Improvement

* **(Nitpick) Scalable Styling:** This is more of a suggestion than a criticism. The class name logic `className={\`toast ${type === "success" ? "toast-success" : "toast-info"}\`}` works perfectly for two types. If you were to add more types (e.g., `warning`, `error`), you might consider a small utility like `clsx` or a simple mapping object to keep the template clean. This is purely a stylistic choice for scalability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

This component is production-ready. It's a textbook example of how to build a small, reusable, and accessible UI component in React. You should be very proud of this one!
